Guardrails for Azure are built using Azure Policy and RBAC.

Guardrail guidance refers to the recommended practice for how to apply each guardrail to your OUs. The guidance of a guardrail is independent of whether its behavior is preventive or detective.
Guardrails are categorized according to their behavior and their guidance. The behavior of each guardrail is either preventive or detective.

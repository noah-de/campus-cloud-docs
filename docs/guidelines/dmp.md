## Data Management Plan (DMP) Guidleines when using UCSB's Campus Cloud
Granting agencies usually require a Data Management Plan (DMP) that addresses types of data, data and metadata standards, policies for access/sharing, provisions for appropriate protection/privacy, policies and provisions for re-use and re-distribution and plans for archiving and preserving access.

Each granting agency has its own requirements, standards and practices limiting the applicability of a generic Cloud informed DMP.

The Campus Cloud team has put together a general statement about what is provided by the curated Campus Cloud environment we call a "Landing Zone" (LZ). Additionally we will provide a number of helpful links including the Digital California Library's DMPTool that should help in creating a DMP when working in the Cloud.

###  Campus Cloud - Features and Benefits for the Researcher
The Campus Cloud LZ provides an efficient way to store data, access files, and develop and host applications. The UC system has negotiated contracts with some Cloud providers to ensure that UC employees have access to cloud services that meet UC requirements for security, privacy and liability.

Using a UC-authorized cloud service provider in the Campus Cloud can help you:
* Keep data safe and secure, protecting it from unauthorized third party access
* Meet federal and state regulations about storing/managing sensitive data
* Reduce risk and liability for the university in the event of a data breach
* Access additional features and storage space

The Campus Cloud adheres to a Shared Responsibility Model for Cloud security and compliance. This framework assigns "Security OF the Cloud" to the Campus Cloud (and its Cloud Providers) and "Security IN the Cloud to the account users. We work together to create a secure place for your research activities.

### Campus Cloud for AWS 
The Campus Cloud for AWS provides an environment of curated products and services with the following key researcher benefits:
* UC-wide Enterprise Discount
* S3 Storage Discount (S3, S3-IA, S3 one-zone IA, Glacier)
* Enterprise Support Program
* Guardrails
* NIST-800-171 Compliance Guardrails
* Networking connectivity to campus (Public and/or Private subnet)
* Visibility & observability
* Compliance & Governance

In order to receive Federal funding the Campus needs to comply with NIST 800-171 Federal standards. UC Policy, IS-3, mandates our requirements for Information Security. The Campus Cloud environment is designed to comply with these standards.

The Campus Cloud for AWS uses the AWS Control Tower service & Guardrails to audit and maintain compliance. Guardrails are rules that define policy. Additionally, the Campus Cloud uses a comprehensive cloud native security platform (CNSP), PaloAlto's PrismCloud,
for users, applications, data, and the entire cloud native technology stack.
